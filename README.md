# BNK-Editor
This is an Editor for BNK files used in some games.

Requirements:
- Correct convert .wem file (Mono/Stereo Vorbis/WhateverCodec)
- Knowing which of the files you want to change (index)
- a .bnk file with usable .wem files

There are still a lot of bugs in there and it is ugly af but it should work for now.
